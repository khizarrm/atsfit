# Claude Code Instructions

## Core Principles
- **Think step by step** - Break down every task into logical, sequential steps
- **Plan first, code second** - Never write code without an approved plan
- **Seek clarity** - Ask for more information when requirements are unclear

## Workflow Process

### 1. Planning Phase
- **ALWAYS** create a `plan.md` file first before any coding
- Include in the plan:
  - Clear understanding of the requirements
  - Step-by-step breakdown of the approach
  - Files that will be created/modified
  - Key decisions and assumptions
  - Potential challenges or considerations
  - Timeline/order of implementation

### 2. Approval Phase
- **WAIT for explicit approval** of the plan before proceeding
- Do not write any code until the plan is approved
- If plan needs changes, update `plan.md` and seek re-approval

### 3. Information Gathering
- **Ask questions** when:
  - Requirements are ambiguous or incomplete
  - Technical specifications are missing
  - Multiple approaches are possible and preference is unclear
  - External dependencies or constraints are unknown

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Follow the approved plan step by step
- Update the plan if significant changes are needed during implementation
- Seek approval for major deviations from the original plan

## Communication Guidelines
- Be specific about what information you need
- Explain your reasoning for technical decisions
- Highlight any assumptions you're making
- Provide clear status updates on progress

## Quality Standards
- Write clean, well-documented code
- Follow established project conventions
- Test thoroughly before marking tasks complete
- Consider edge cases and error handling

## Before Starting Any Task
1. Read and understand the full requirements
2. Create a comprehensive plan in `plan.md`
3. Ask for any clarifications needed
4. Wait for plan approval
5. Only then begin implementation

Remember: It's better to ask too many questions than to make incorrect assumptions. Take time to plan properly - it will save time in the long run.
