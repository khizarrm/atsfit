# Keyword Extractor Improvement Plan

## Problem Analysis
The current keyword extractor has several critical issues:
1. **Extracts irrelevant content**: Company-specific info, benefits, salary ranges
2. **Poor filtering**: No distinction between technical vs. non-technical terms
3. **Overly broad scope**: Captures entire phrases instead of focused keywords
4. **No prioritization**: All keywords treated equally regardless of ATS importance
5. **Missing key technical terms**: Doesn't specifically target skills, technologies, qualifications

## Current Output Problems
From your example, the extractor captures:
- Salary ranges: "$39600.00 - $69300.00"
- Company benefits: "a 401(k) plan", "basic life insurance"
- Irrelevant phrases: "a balanced, values-driven environment", "immense pride"
- Legal text: "personal data", "applicant privacy notice"
- Non-actionable content: "at least one", "ability", "connection"

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Create Focused Keyword Categories
- **Technical Skills**: Programming languages, frameworks, tools, technologies
- **Soft Skills**: Leadership, communication, problem-solving abilities
- **Qualifications**: Degrees, certifications, experience requirements
- **Job Functions**: Specific role responsibilities and duties

### 2. Implement Smart Filtering System
- **Technology Dictionary**: Maintain curated lists of relevant tech terms
- **Section-Based Extraction**: Parse different job posting sections differently
- **Relevance Scoring**: Weight keywords by importance for ATS systems
- **Noise Removal**: Filter out company names, benefits, legal text

### 3. Enhanced Text Processing
- **Better Tokenization**: Focus on individual terms and relevant phrases
- **Skill Identification**: Use pattern matching for technical skills
- **Context Awareness**: Understand which section of job posting we're in
- **Synonym Handling**: Map related terms to standard vocabulary

### 4. Output Optimization
- **Categorized Results**: Group keywords by type (technical, soft skills, etc.)
- **Priority Ranking**: Score keywords by ATS relevance
- **Deduplication**: Remove redundant or overlapping terms
- **Clean Formatting**: Present results in ATS-friendly format

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Keyword Databases
- Technical skills dictionary (languages, frameworks, tools)
- Soft skills dictionary (leadership, communication, etc.)
- Industry-standard job function terms
- Common qualification patterns

### Step 2: Implement Section Detection
- Identify different parts of job posting (requirements, responsibilities, etc.)
- Apply different extraction strategies per section
- Skip irrelevant sections (benefits, legal, company info)

### Step 3: Build Smart Extraction Logic
- Replace simple noun chunk extraction with targeted pattern matching
- Implement skill-specific regex patterns
- Add context-aware filtering
- Create relevance scoring algorithm

### Step 4: Add Post-Processing
- Categorize extracted keywords
- Remove duplicates and noise
- Rank by ATS importance
- Format for easy resume integration

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
- Test with sample job postings
- Validate against known good keyword lists
- Ensure extraction quality meets ATS standards

## Files to Modify
- `keyword-extracter.py` - Main extraction logic
- New files to create:
  - `keyword_databases.py` - Technical and soft skill dictionaries
  - `section_parser.py` - Job posting section detection
  - `keyword_scorer.py` - Relevance scoring logic

## Expected Improvements
- **Higher Precision**: Only relevant ATS keywords extracted
- **Better Organization**: Categorized output for targeted resume updates
- **Reduced Noise**: Eliminate irrelevant company/benefits information
- **ATS Optimization**: Focus on terms that actually improve ATS scoring
- **Actionable Results**: Keywords that can directly enhance resume content

## Target Output Example
Instead of extracting noise like "a 401(k) plan", the improved system should extract:

**Technical Skills:**
- Python, TypeScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL
- AWS, Docker, Terraform
- CI/CD, microservices, REST APIs

**Soft Skills:**
- Problem-solving, collaboration, mentorship
- Project management, communication

**Qualifications:**
- Bachelor's degree, Software Engineering
- 3.0+ GPA, GitHub portfolio

**AI/ML Skills:**
- GenAI, prompt engineering, AI automation
- Claude Code, AI-assisted development

## Success Metrics
- Extract 80%+ relevant technical skills from job postings
- Reduce noise keywords by 90%
- Categorize keywords accurately (technical, soft skills, qualifications)
- Provide actionable keywords for resume optimization
